Peace be upon you. We worked with population data from Our World in Data. The specific CVS dataset can be downloaded from 
https://ourworldindata.org/population-growth#explore-data-poverty. 

The dataset is an annual time-series by country of population, both total population and population by various demographic groups.We have worked on this dataset according to assignment instruction only and have not explored much.
If you are interested in doing so, you can make changes and we will appreciate if you can let us know with that as well!
